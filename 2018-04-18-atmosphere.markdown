post-par1: Hej guys! It's Kiki from science team! Today I am going to say some things about our atmosphere and why the altitudes that the balloon will fly, are perfect for our Tubular experiment!  

post-par2: Imagine the atmosphere as a thick blanket of gases, that surrounds earth and stays in place because of the gravity. It is the protector of life, creating pressure that allows water to remain liquid. It consists of Nitrogen, Oxygen, Argon and a small number of other gases. But this is not the only reason why the atmosphere is important. It also absorbs the ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface, an effect known as the greenhouse effect. The three major greenhouse gases are water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane. Strengthening of the greenhouse effect through human activities is known as anthropogenic greenhouse effect which leads to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and thus, global warming.

post-par3: And here comes TUBULAR! As you probably already know, the experiment will collect air from the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, approximately between 15 and 25 km. And it is where one can find the higher concentration of greenhouse gases!  Also, the Arctic is of special interest, when it comes to global warming research. Meridional winds, push the greenhouse gases from the equator to the poles, resulting in higher concentrations of greenhouse gases at the poles than any other place!

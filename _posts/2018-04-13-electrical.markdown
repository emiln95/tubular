post-par1: Hej guys, today I will give you a general overview of the dealings or should I say hardships of the electrical team. Just kidding! If you dare to read the whole blog then you also get to know about some stuff currently going on in the department. The electrical team is responsible to design a foolproof system which can successfully collect the air samples. But, there are many factors which need to be considered to achieve this objective. Some of them are power availability, restrictions due to mechanical design, interfaces between components, available funding and the list goes on. Besides this, we must cope with the slightest change in the design or after each iteration of the experiment review.   

post-par2: These days, the team is working on the schematics, finalizing components list, and budgeting power for the electrical system. The lessons learned by the team thus far enhanced its understanding of the electronics design as well as gained confidence in selecting appropriate components as per requirements. By reading through a large number of data sheets, the team is now able to easily extract and understand technical details.
post-par3: Keep coming back to read the tubular posts. As the project continues to move toward the Critical Design Review, we will try to keep you guys updated on our problems and design. Thank you for visiting us today and reading my blog.

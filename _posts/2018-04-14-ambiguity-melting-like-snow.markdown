post-par1: Hej, good readers! This time it's another shout from your friendly neighborhood thermal team! My name is Ivan and when I am not working on BEXUS Thermal, I am on the watch for the Swedish spring approaching. The snow outside is melting quite quickly now - maybe spring will arrive in Kiruna by end of April, who knows?
As the surfaces once concealed beneath these thick white blankets now come more into view, so too do our answers to the temperatures we can expect to see throughout the different elements of our experiment!

post-par2: But just like with nature's tendency to make snow suddenly come back harshly for brief periods when one thinks winter is finally over, so too can cascading errors in calculations derail entire section analyses on paper and in LaTex! For example, while equations for how sunlight heats up our aluminum cover when nothing shields it seem to make sense - temperatures neither too high nor too low from what could be expected (at least in the stratosphere), the results become dramatically higher, if not impossibly hot (well over 100 Celsius) for the aluminum when it is protected beneath a canvas cloth draped over the experiment's gondola frame. The shielding actually gets much hotter than the material responsible for protecting it from incoming radiation!

post-par3: Something within the formulae being used must clearly not be adding up and this is expected to be resolved really soon! Once this matter is cleared up, then the numerical results will be (hopefully) comparable to the ones gained in the coming weeks from finite element simulations done on our experiment's CAD model (courtesy of our mechanical team).

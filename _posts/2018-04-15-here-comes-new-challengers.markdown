post-par1: Hej guys! Project Manager Georges here, back in the microblogging game. What a busy week it's been for everyone as we push to get some schematics done in time for the Critical Design Review at ESTEC. End of May is not that far away!

post-par2: There's definitely a lot of work left to be done si that's why we now have two new team members who have joined the team. A warm welcome to Emily and Erik!

post-par3: You're already heard about Erik from the blogpost he published a few days ago. Erik has joined the Thermal Division. As for Emily, she joined the Mechanical Division and you'll hear more about her tomorrow when she publishes her blogpost.

post-par4: Today's lesson is that when the going gets tough, don't hesitate to reach out for help. There are plenty of cool people out there like Emily and Erik who can save the day. That's it for now folks, over and out.

post-par1: Hej hej! The bags tests' preparation is on! These last weeks we have been busy trying to find out every detail for the tests, and here I am, updating you… We have decided that there will be two different tests concerning the bags. 



post-par2: The first one will be a test in which we will analyse the stability and holding times of the bags probably combined with condensation. Our main concern is the recovery time and since the BEXUS organizers cannot assure us a recovery in less than 48h, it is our responsibility to test what would happen to our samples if we had to wait more than two days. In addition, the more we wait, the more risks we can have of getting condensation inside the bags due to negative temperatures during the night. 



post-par3: For this test, we will need to fill the bags with calibrated gases. A calibrated gas means that we already know the concentration of gases we are introducing in the bag. Then we will wait for more than 48h to analyse the bags and compare the results with the initial concentration. Regarding the condensation problem, we are studying the possibility to use magnesium perchlorate filters which will trap the water molecules before getting inside the bags and avoid condensation. After analysing the bags with the Picarro analyser, we will check for water vapour content to see if there has been condensation or not. 



post-par4: As you might have noticed, we need a Picarro analyser that we don't have here in Kiruna. But here it comes… The most exciting news!  The science team is going to visit the Finnish Meteorological Institute in Sodankylä! And now you must be thinking… What about the second test she mentioned? Well… You will have to wait for my next post to know about the other test!

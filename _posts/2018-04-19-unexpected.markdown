post-par1: Good evening! I am Jorgito from Mechanics. This week has been really busy in our Department! On my way to catch up with all our Asana tasks I've been diving through endless catalogs from various companies trying to figure out how can we build the structure of both boxes without wasting too much money.

post-par2: Moreover, I've been playing for the first time in my life with ANSYS. Broadly speaking, it's a software that, in one of its modules, allow us to reproduce different load situations on the structure and see how it behaves. So yes, as I'm sure you already know, today's picture is one of the results of these simulations. In particular, the displacement magnitudes of the structure when a load of 2000 kg is applied on the right side of the small box.

post-par3: Discouraging, isn't it? Apparently it would break. Indeed, looking at one of the other results, the maximum equivalent stress that would appear in the weakest point of our structure is 2484 MPa! It's quite funny when you realise that the Ultimate Tensile Strength of the Aluminum 6501-T5 is 310 MPa, which is the material used to manufacture our components.

post-par4: What to say... nowadays materials are so weak and whimsical. Do you think that 2000 kg are too much? Let's pray for a good parachute and a soft landing! God help us!

post-par1: The Arduino Due and ethernet clock in at a combined weight of 64 grams.
A small cog in a much larger machine, the TUBULAR experiment. The 
experiment takes form and materilizes from our minds into things that 
arrives in carboard boxes to our mentors office. While the electrical 
and mechanical peeple get their goodies the software team relies on our 
old faithful Due to make do. 

post-par2: We're continuing to chisel away on the
software. It is as my compraiot said during our talk with our ESA mentors,
We have started to code. We have of course done more than that. One thing 
however we have not yet done is unit testing. Right now our main
test of the code been by compiling and checking to see what error messages 
come our way, which isn't the best methodology to write good, safe code. 

post-par3: Since we have not designed our code to be tested in this manner it will 
hopefully provide an intresting learning experience. A lot of hard work 
lies ahead in making it functional but I am committed to make an effort in 
making unit testing practical.

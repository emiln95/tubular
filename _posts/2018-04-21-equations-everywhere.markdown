 post-par1: Hej says thermal again. For the last week we have been busy with the heat equations. Making sure nothing is forgotten and left for chance when we are going to fly. 
 
 post-par2: You might know the critical parts for a BEXUS flight if not here they come. First we have the time waiting on the launche pad before liftoff. Then comes the ascent where it can get as cold as -80 degrees somtimes and will be our coldest case. Then when we have come to around 25km the float will start and while enjoying the view from up above evrything will be resting before the descent. In the end of the float will be the hotest case and then it goes down. During decent it is not so critical, free faling how bad can it be? But we are lucky and have a parachute so no free fall all the way. When we finaly have landed the last critical part is and that is to not let it get to cold when waiting for recovery.
 
 post-par3: Now you have read something you might have know or got a new fun fact to tell your friends and family about the critical temperature parts of a BEXUS flight. Until next time.

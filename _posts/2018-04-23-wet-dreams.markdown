post-par1: Hej everyone! Second lap here to keep you up to date on mechanical development status. Taking over my previous post, the design of the valve center (the place where we will allocate all the valves dedicated to the new sampling method with bags) is reaching its final stages. On the last talk with our mentors, a mindful idea arose on how to solve the flushing issue of the tube connecting the valves and the bags. It was proposed to use a T interface just before the bags so we can flush the tube with nitrogen before the flight. The latter will allow as to both flush the tubes and test all the valves. Awesome solution, isn't it?

post-par2: Regarding the valves, a new vendor was found and they have our wet dreams manifold! We are in contact with them to order racks of valves stacked together so no custom-made valve center box is needed. The main task now is to finally determine the sizes of the interfaces we will use, it is pendant while we do not have a serious confirmation from the vendor. Whereas, the custom-made sensor box, where we will allocate all the sensors required for our later science analysis, is going through iterations since it will have to withstand the pumped air (located just after the pump as it can be seen in the image above). 

post-par3: Waiting for a final version of electronicsâ€™ schematics so we can start working together on deciding how we arrange all the elements inside the Electronics Box. By the way, today in my home country, Catalonia, we celebrate Saint Jorge (Sant Jordi in catalan). It is the day in which all women are given a rose by her lover and all men receive a book to read: sort of a culture day!

post-par4: You all know what to do today, spread love and culture ;) Over now, mechanical power!

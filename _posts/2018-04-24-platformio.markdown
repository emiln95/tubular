post-par1: Hej guuuysss!!!! Today is my turn to write the blog. I would like to share some experience about choosing Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
post-par2: So, in January, we decided to use Arduino IDE, because it is simple, and official from arduino itself. Then. we wrote the code in a project with several .ino files. The advantage of arduino is, we can split the code into several files without headers to link them. (CONVENIENT!!).
post-par3: Then, some weeks ago, we, software team (a couple of "not so pro programmer"), learned from our project manager about unit testing, which is a testing for functionality, protocol, algorithm of the software. After that, we started searching and sesarching how to unit test arduino IDE based code. Then we found nothing useful. Two days ago, I found a new IDE called PlatformIO (https://platformio.org). It provides unit testing service (GREAT!!), but it is not free (UGH!!).
post-par4: Then, I contacted the company asking about the possibility of free trial extension until BEXUS is finished. AAANNNDDD, we got it!! See you on the next blog post!! I will share some experience about unit testing using PlatformIO IDE.

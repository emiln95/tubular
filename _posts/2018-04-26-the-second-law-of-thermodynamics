post-par1: Welcome back, good readers! You know how the Second Law of Thermodynamics works? Well, the title is enough of an intro for anyone unfamiliar. We here at Team Thermal aspire to keep things simple. We’ll have to, for as long as we can anyway. As I find myself behind others every so often in this grand BEXUS endeavor, I find it helps to be near the others when the going gets tough. This way, one can get brought up to speed pretty quickly (it helps that you’ll have an easier time copying information from peers and siphoning from their motivation as is needed). Hey, it’s a dog eat dog world, and the laws of thermodynamics prove this to be no exception. It wouldn’t surprise me if they were at the center of it all for social behaviors!

post-par2: But I digress. Remember that ambiguity I talked about last time I wrote here? Well, a lot of that went away with the snow, just as it should! Thanks to the efforts of comrade Erik, the coding has been set up, and it now works beautifully. It will take a bit more tweaking to get the exact right numbers, but this is now less than a day’s work! After that, there won’t be much left in the way for theoretical predictions (I suppose they can’t be called hand calculations anymore...).

post-par3: Things will get even more heated within the next couple of weeks as we prepare for the SED 2.0 submission! I for one, however, think that things will go more smoothly than they did in our first official submission. Remember, I also did say the future bids a warm welcome...

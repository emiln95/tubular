post-par1: Hej hej People! it's me, Georges, your favourite PM. In this blogpost I want to talk about the importance of being skpetic. Over here at TUBULAR HQ, the entire team is always excited about the idea of building the experiment that we tend to brush off the finer nitty gritty details as just a matter of connecting part X with part Y and voila it's that simple so what could possibly go wrong?
post-par2: You see the picture above? The struggle is real. That's our very own Emily Chen after being asked to figure out the exact component needed to connect part X with part Y. Oh and turns out that researching this has revealed that we also have to seal part Z as well. You see the point I'm trying to make? Turns out it's not as magic as it sounds and there's a lot of things to consider such as material, orifice diameters, temperature ranges, and the list goes on and on.
post-par3: What helps is drawing diagrams and schematics for absolutely everything. Even if it's just a shameful early draft with stick figures. It really helps to start revealing the missing details that all of us have been guilty of not considering. The blog picture is of Emily, but rest assured that we've all gone through this. So people, be skeptic about things just working out like Legos until you've sketched it all out!
post-par4: PM Georges, over and out.

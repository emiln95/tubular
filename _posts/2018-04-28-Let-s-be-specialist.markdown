post-par1: Hello everyone! It’s Emily from the mechanical team again! Last post, I gave you guys a brief description on the CAC set up and today I will try to explain it in details so we all can be CAC specialists after this post! 

post-par2: As we already known the CAC is a combination of a 200 m of 3.175 mm and 100 m of 6.35 mm stainless steel tubes. At each free end it is connected to a manual valve. The valve which is connected to the 100m tube, will also be linked to a magnesium dryer tube. It contains magnesium perchlorate and its function is to ensure that no moisture enters the tubes during sampling. A solenoid valve will be inserted between the dryer tube and a 50 cm tube that will reach outside of the box. Between all these connections, there will be interfaces linking together different types of the tube ends such as female respective male ends. 

post-par3: When everything is set, the next step is to fill CAC with a nitrogen gas, by letting the free end of 50 cm tube be attached to a nitrogen gas tank. When the filling process is done, the manual valve (attached to the 200m tube) and the solenoid valve will be closed. The CAC will then almost be ready to go up in the sky. With almost I mean of course a lot of tests and verifying needs to be done before the real deal, but that will be another story. 

post-par4: This was all from me today, see you guys next time and until then please stay healthy!

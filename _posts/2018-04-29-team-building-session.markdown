post-par1: Hej hej! Today it's me, Nuria, posting again. I know in my last post I promised to tell you about the second test related to the bags but instead I want to talk about team bonding. 



post-par2: Yesterday team TUBULAR had a team building session, we had an improvised BBQ at Hagelstigen (student apartments in Kiruna). It was a sunny day up in the north, and team TUBULAR, mostly formed by non-Swedish students, started feeling like swedes, so we decided to go out and enjoy the nice POSITIVE 2 degrees and the extra sunlight hours (the sun sets after 10pm), the perfect weather combination for a barbeque! 



post-par3: Working in a team is not always a bed of roses, people have different opinions, different ways of working or organizing themselves. Your work does not only depend on you, sometimes you need to wait for others to finish their task so that you can finish yours, or sometimes a decision that another member of the team makes, affects your own work, giving you much more work to do.



post-par4: All those situations can create internal conflicts and it could be that some people held a grudge against someone else. This is the reason why a team building session is so important so that we can bond with each other and smooth things over. After all, we are not only a team, we are a family and we should all be able to separate work and friendship! All the problems should not be taken personally, it is always much more pleasant to work with happy people!

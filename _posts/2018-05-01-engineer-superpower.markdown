post-par1: This has been a really exasperating week. Big input, small output. Many tentatives, only one “final” solution. As everything in this life, it begins with questions, QUESTIONS EVERYWHERE! How attach the experiment to the gondola? How attach both boxes each other? How easily access the interior of the gondola without unscrewing the whole Eiffel tower? Where allocate the electronic box? How to fix the bags inside the structure? How can we connect the AirCore valve with the electronic box if they are allocated in two different enclosures that will be separated after (and before) the flight? … (endless list to infinity and beyond). And after all, I’m sure you will ask another one, were not all these questions already answered? Yes! You are right, in theory. But here is where the struggle comes to knock on your door. Are all those solutions compatible with the vendors products? Kill me.

post-par2: Trying to turn all the ideal designs into something that we can really touch. This (for people without any experience in manufacturing) requires that kind of anticipation that allows you to realize that these apparently amazing connectors you had found in the endless catalogue of a supplier doesn’t work on your structure because, after building everything mentally, you figure out that the last wall can’t be pinned because you should screw it from the inside of the box. Then, that precise moment when your mind has gone because it’s tired of being tortured, is when you start trying to put someone of the team inside the experiment. And then is also when you realize that you are not working anymore.

post-par3: I’m feeling like Dr Strange anticipating possible futures to figure out in which one the experiment is properly build and operative. I wish I could have the time stone too but, come on, then that would be a piece of cake. 

post-par4: Once I read that a question has not been answered until two more questions have took its place, which I can tell you right now how damn right it is. The only thing I want right now is to see what I don’t have in front of me. And that’s all about, the engineer superpower, to read things that are not yet on the page.

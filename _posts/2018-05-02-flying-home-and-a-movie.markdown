post-par1: Hello, fans of Tubular or should say hi to Georges and the few others who are reading this blog. Today I will be flying home to Scania to meet my family. Hopefully it will be sunshine, warmth and the brisk smell of spring in the air that his absent from the north.

post-par2: But I digress, you come here to read about our progress in the project and not about the weather. Luckily software is one of the things one can work on anywhere, as long as there is coffee and the abilty to google stack Overflow. 

post-par3: But first I must talk about a recent activites we have done. After two team building activities in such short period the groups morale is on top. One of the activities was watching a period peace set in the contemporary era. I saw myself reflected in the movie's protagonist, a tragic man who lost his planet but still carried on, determined to stop similar atrocites happening on other worlds. Despite what socity thought about his plans he stuck to his guns and didn't let anyone stand in the way of his dreams. I myself can only hope to have that kind of commitment that displayed. 

post-par4: It also followed the tribulations of a group of friends determined to protect their home from invaders. While not as intacing as the main plot it still managed to explore some deep themes about group dynamics when that group is faced with titanic problems. I could really se our group reflected onto that screen, a truly mesmerizing experience. I hope my fellow Tubulars will also be inspired the same way I was by this masterpice, our Citizen Kane of our generation.

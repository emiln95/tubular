post-par1: Hej hej. I hope you remember a few weeks ago I introduced you to one of our most critical components, the pump. Well since then not only has the pump arrived but we've also managed to complete two tests! This was super important for us as to pass the next review we had to prove that our pump would work with the low pressure found at high altitudes.

post-par2: Luckily for us our careful research paid off and the pump had no problems turning on at 30hPa, which is equivilant to being at 24km altitude  ^0^

post-par3: Though this only marks the start of our testing with some future gems to look forward to including abusing our components by freezing them, shaking them violently and rounding off with a couple of 10 hour long tests that will be a fun bonding experience for the whole team to enjoy.

post-par4: Here's hoping that the rest of our tests go as well as our first ^-^

post-par1: Hi everyone! Another day, another blog from your very own, most favorite, Electrical team. 

post-par2: We are now into the last week before the submission of our Critical Design Review (CDR) which is due on Monday next week (14.05.18). So, we kicked off our first day of this last week with one big meeting to get everyone on board about the overall design structure and all the interfaces required between different experiment boxes. 

post-par3: From todayâ€™s discussion, I believe that electrical team does not require to change any of its design elements. But, the dimensions of the PCB boards need to take into consideration to check if everything could be placed well within the limits of the main electronics box provided by the mechanical team. And, I am sure within this weak we will figure out the answer to this question. This is not the only task, there are a lot of things needed to be done for this week. So, wish us good luck and thank you for reading my blog today.

post-par1: Hello again, good readers! The week of SED 2.0 finalization is upon us! This means plenty of work for each one of us! And not just in our division either – but our respective sections in the SED itself – it’s double the trouble! Maybe the rubble too, if we start collapsing under the pressure. With all this work needing to get done, my very dreams will probably be filled with equations, balloons, and snow (because apparently you not safe from snow even in May if you live in Kiruna)! The flames burn within me from this pressure – but I channel them into productivity I never knew I had!

post-par2: So once again, much has happened since the last time you delightful readers might have seen my name in the author’s ID slot! Both Erik and I have updated our respective chunks of the Matlab code, so now the output data is not only more accurate (on my part), but also more comprehensive (Erik’s part)! The main Matlab file can now display various temperatures both with and without direct radiation from the sun. Other than that, he continues with Ansys simulations and I continue with my tables of thermal properties for air... These tables give the convection values for my script, which leads into his main script, and those results are what go into the 3D simulations of thermal flux.

post-par3: The workload may make my composure crack every so often – characterized by my proclivity for shouting profanity. But I find a good way to relax in times like these to be to listen to music that could describe the situation concisely. I felt the custom visualization playing with this song also deserved to be shared.

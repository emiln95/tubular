post-par1: Hej people! Project Manager Georges here announcing the addition of a new team member to the electrical division. Say hello to Emil! Yesterday I overheard him say the word "MOSFET" so I believe he is competent and we all look very forward to the much needed help, particularly over the summer during the building phase.

post-par2: In other news, after making sure to remind everyone about posting their blogpost on time I have shamefully posted this one a day late. What! The penalty for this offense will be double posting from yours truly. That should discourage others from following my poor example. So, later today you'll get another blogpost from me and still one from Emily. That's 3 in one day, times are a crazy.

post-part3: Conclusion... a big welcome to Emil!

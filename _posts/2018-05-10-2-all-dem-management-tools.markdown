post-par1: People, it's my second post of the day. In my post from a few hours ago I explained how I forgot to post yesterday and the price to pay is double posting. I hereby officiate this new rule with this post! Certainly, it will discourage others from following my poor example. 
post-par2: This time around I'm going to talk to you about some of the management tools we use to keep things relatively smooth and on track with deliverables. Managing a project can be very exciting but talking about it is complete snoreville so I'll be brief and cut to the chase. Ready? Here we go!
post-par3: We use Asana's Kanban board to manage and assign tasks and we loosely base our approach to planning with something called th Agile Methodology, do look it up! When someone's task doesn't pass Review, it goes to Not Accepted and the person who was assigned the task in question usual whines about it but in the end it's extra motivation for him or her to get the job done thoroughly because nobody like to see their task marked as Not Accepted, not even yours truly. Yuck! For documentation we use ShareLaTeX, it's awesome for collaborative work and I personally get quite into the Zen zone when formatting formulas in it. Everytime we deliver a new version of our Student Experiment Documentation (SED), we synchronize the LaTeX code with our project source code repository in GitHub so that we preserve a snapshot of that specific version of the document for posterity to enjoy, kinda like a time capsule.
post-par4: To track my time I use nifty little Android app called Timesheet. Along with your time, you can log the mood you were in while you worked on your task and then come up with a nice little report about your mood swings throughout the project. Maybe I should include that report in SED v2.0 that's due this coming Monday!

post-par1: Hi! Today is Nuria writing the blogpost. This week is being our busiest week since we are submitting the SED 2.0 on Monday 14th. Furthermore, Natalie and I travelled for two days to the Finish Meteorological Institute. During our stay there, we got to meet Rigel Kivi and Pauli Heikkinen, two scientists that work at the FMI and are collaborating on our project.

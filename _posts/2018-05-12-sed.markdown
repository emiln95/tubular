post-par1: Tjena kexen! (should i ask a sponsorship from m&ms?!) Hope this post finds you well! I am Kiki and I’ll give you a brief updated of what TUBULAR people are up to! Actually, I can say it all in one word, SED.
post-par2: Does this ring you a bell? I thought so! So, the deadline is in two days. This means that there are no distinctions between the departments. We all work together as one, on this loooong document, making sure that everything about the experiment is crystal clear. Nothing more than work work work work work. Boring?  
post-par3: The weather on the other hand, is not boring. For you who may not know, in Kiruna you can experience ALL four seasons in ONE day. Sunny and slightly windy spring day in the morning, progressing to warm summer in midday, to autumn rain in the afternoon, concluding into cold rainy winter in the evening! IN 24 HOURS. !@#$%^&
post-par4: I will close this post with a Rocky Balboa quote. “Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!” Cheesy but true! xxx

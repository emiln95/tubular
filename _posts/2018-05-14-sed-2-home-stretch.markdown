post-par1: Day 3, rations are running low, and with it group morale. It all started when that dammed mist rolled in over town. The church thats just some one hundred meters away are obscured from view due to the fog. Outside there are persons..no that the wrong word, they might have a human silhouette but they are most assuredly not human. But they  stayed where outside, the worst of it was inside woth us, The SED 2.0 writing. The looming deadline hanged above us. I think all of this just broke Kicki, she just suddenly stood up and went outside and never comeback. I sure can't blame her, I myself have also contemplated just to leave and seek my fate in the mist. Whatever fate befalled her out there, I... I hope she traverssed the mist safetly and are better place. However I should know better after looking outside. Hopefully we can finish this SED without any further losses.

post-par2: Day 5, We're all alive and no one went missing in the mist. After working on the SED for what feels like an eternity we're nearing completion. Only a few screws left to turn and we will have completed SED 2.0 and we can relax by studying for the exams.

post-par1: Once more the sun sets and we are one more day closer until we shall fly. Even if a day in the span of months is nothing, today have brought us a lot closer. Finally the SED v2.0 have been sent in. The last week have been rough and a lot of late evenings have been spent working hard and at the same time bonding as a team.
 
post-par2: The dream of flight we share to go beyond the clouds where everything is possible. We in TUBULAR come from different places in the world but here we are working together, for me I could not have believed to be doing something like this before I started studying at the university.
 
post-par3: Now we shall only fix the last small things and go present for CDR our next goal. Then comes the summer soon (already here thinks the crazy Swedish person) and the most fun part of building.
 
post-par4: Time to sign out and we in thermal say enjoy the summer that now is here and seeya until next time.

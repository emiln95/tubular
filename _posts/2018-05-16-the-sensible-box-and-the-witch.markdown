post-par1: After completing the craziest week of BEXUS so far where the team somehow pulled over 800 hours between everyone, that's 114 team hours a day or on average a 60+ hour work week for everyone, we finally had our SED v2.0 finished and ready to send. Or so we thought...

post-par2: There's nothing quite like the realisation that you really should read through the whole SED and that you probably shouldn't skip out the appendices. Followed by the secondary realisation that you probably shouldn't have looked at the total page number and living a life in ignorance is indeed bliss. 293 pages and nearly an hour later I had finally finished traversing the highs and lows of the SED. I leave my review below.

post-par3: From the beautiful scenes set in chapter 1 the introductions of all the major characters was sublime. The exposition and build up in chapter 4, where our sensible box began its journey, was nothing short of literary genius and the magnificent twists that occured in chapter 5 truly had me on the edge of my seat. The way the authors gave the resolution in chapter 7 brought a small tear to my eye, it was truly wonderful to see the sensible box overcome all the trials and tribulations set out before it. Though the shocking introduction of the witch in Appendix I leaves me impatient to read the sequel.

post-par4: Overall I would rate this SED 10/10. With a solid story and well fleshed out characters this piece is surely destined to become a staple in literature. I would recommend it to all as a perfect piece for some bed time reading.

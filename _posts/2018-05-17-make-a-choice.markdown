post-par1: Hej everyone! Well, as you see in the picture the Write-a-thon had some consequences. Not mcuh sleep during 5 days. An average of 4 hours selpt per day, 88 hours (that time when you forget to go to the toilet for 15 hours, PB don't tell my mum) of 3D design, interfaces everywhere and a loooot of writting and reviewing. I guess the non existing night in Kiruna made it sort of a unique experience. To be working at 3am it is easier when you have sunlight. 

post-par2: Our working days where long, really loooooong. I never work with music but man, this time was necessary. I love politics, mostly catalan politics, but I had never though that a political debate would help to concentrate that much. Oh but the way, Catalonia has a president now (FINALLY), as Tubular we are getting closer and closer to the Critical point of no return... if the pnel allows it (and by panel I mean supreme court, I hope I do not get imprisoned...). 
post-par3: I define myself as a perfecionist, so even after having submitted SED 2.0, I wanted to make sure everything was right. Therefore, I did a double-check. DAMN it! I discovered I have to change the lovely interfaces of the pneumatic system.. AGAIN. The latter implies some 3D changes as well, not to talk budgetwise... Over now, I leave you with Kiki for the last words, she has to say someting about between my rebel to young kid change.
post-par4: Catalans! (rolling my eyes as i write).. Or it's just him? Anyway, i just made a comment that i prefer him as his rebel self with a beard and here i am now, taking over his blogpost and have nothing more to say! But since i am 100% sure that you are as much curious as i am about these 3D interfaces that have caused soo many problems and arguments, before even anyone gets to touch them, I'll tell you what. Almost midnight and you get to vote. Which Pau do you prefer? Before or After? One lucky winner will come to TUBULAR headquarters in Kiruna to meet Pau in person and his lovely interfaces of the pneumatic system. Of course the trip is on Pau ;)
